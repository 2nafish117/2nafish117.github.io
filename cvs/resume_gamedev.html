| `Litworks Project`             Gamifying the expirience of onboarding new employees into a company.
| `Verlet Physics based Rope plugin for Godot` A Highly Customizable and fast implementation of rope physics that uses verlet integration, perlin noise for wind forces, gravity, air damping and primitive collisions. Has 42 stars and 5 forks on [GitHub](https://github.com/2nafish117/godot-verlet-rope), view [plugin demo](https://youtu.be/gcDAxX27E3U), [wind test](https://youtu.be/aJdADPPx0b4) on YouTube.
| `Grapple System` Like the one found in Titanfall 2, uses the rope plugin mentioned above. view [here](https://youtu.be/YCmaHjnPSHI). It has since been improved to pull rigidbodies towards the player and attach onto moving platforms.
| `Bhop` An experiment to understand how bunnyhopping works, playable [here](https://2nafish117.itch.io/bhop), view demo [here](https://youtu.be/h5aB48o39ZI).
| `Slice Of Light (theme: light)` 2d platformer where you reclaim your lost colors by completing 7 challenging levels each to regain one color of the rainbow. Developed in 12 hours for **GG GameJam 2018 at PES College** where it won **3rd place**, playable [here](https://2nafish117.itch.io/slice-of-light).
| `RecOrd Yourself (theme: rewind)` 2d puzzle platformer where you can record yourself and use your recorded clone to solve puzzles. Developed for the **Brackeys Gamejam 2020.2**, playable [here](https://2nafish117.itch.io/record-yourself).
| `The Weekend (theme: relax)` A game where you play a guy who just got off work and plans to relax on the weekend. Developed for the **Untitled Gamejam #41**, playable [here](https://2nafish117.itch.io/the-weekend).
| `Yeet n Skeet` Platformer where you reach the goal while collecting coins, walljumping and avoiding a rising flood. playable [here](https://2nafish117.itch.io/yeet-n-skeet).
| `Viewmodel Animations` AK-47 and G3 first person animations in Blender. view [here](https://youtu.be/4GcZYHSwj1I) and [here](https://youtu.be/mtx7Vl-_Poo).
| `FPS Test Projects` Developed to test out Rigidbody Charecter controllers like in Half Life 2 and responsive FPS movement like in Doom: Eternal, playable [hl2](https://2nafish117.itch.io/retro-fps) and [doom](https://2nafish117.itch.io/gdoom).
| `Developed a Renderer in C++ with modern OpenGl` It uses the phong lighting model with a base color texture and specular texture mask on objects. In addition to this it connects via udp sockets to consume mobile phone orientation data to move the camera. 
| `Programmed a maze solver` that reads the maze from a bitmap or plaintext file and uses Djikstra's algorithm to solve it, then writes the path into another bitmap or plaintext file.  -->

| `SEP 2020 - PRESENT` **Engineer, Sling Media Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India** Worked on the backend metadata services for SlingTV. Contributed in launching 8 third party channels, feature additions for dynamic ad insertion and server side ad insertion, channel blacklisting and various bug fixes. Working on moving legacy sling services to microservices architecture.
| `JAN 2020 - JULY 2020` **Intern, Sling Media Pvt Ltd, Bangalore, India** Developed a system to detect and match faces of charecters from every scene of the movie to a database of known actors and generate metadata to display the actors in the current scene during the playback of the movie. Used python Dlib, opencv, to detect and match faces, pyscenedetect to detect scene transitions, MongoDB to cache the metadata, python Flask for the webapp.
| `MAY 2019 - JULY 2019` **Intern, Samsung R&D, Bangalore, India** Ported a REST service to gRPC with protobuf messages, to test the performance of protobuf over gRPC vs json over http.
| `JUN 2018 - JULY 2018` **Intern, Aeronautical Development Establishment, Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Bangalore, India.** Developed a tool written in C to parse and convert LCA flight simulator data to C structs in header files for further processing in MATLAB. -->
