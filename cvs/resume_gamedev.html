<li><code>SEP 2022 - PRESENT</code> <strong>VR Game Developer, i3
Simulations / MergeXR, Bangalore, India</strong></br> Lead developer on
a project in collaboration with Singaporeâ€™s group of healthcare
institutions to accurately recreate the Inner Ear for Canal Wall Down
Mastiodectomy Surgery with haptic devices with force feedback in VR.
Research concluded with users having on average 24% improvement in
surgical skills post usage of ENT simulator compared to baseline.</br>
Personally designed &amp; developed a tool to automate color correction
for Virtual Production in UE5.</br> Designed &amp; implemented an
analytics system for ongoing unity VR medical simulation projects,
application generates events that are stored into a local embedded
database that can be queried to generate session analytics.</br> Added
functional tests to a scenario based VR medical simulation project in
UE4 that reduced testing time required by the QA team.</li>
<li><code>SEP 2020 - SEP 2022</code> <strong>Engineer, Sling Media Pvt
Ltd, Bangalore, India</strong> Worked on the backend metadata services
